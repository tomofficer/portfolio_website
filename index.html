        <h2 class="border-1">About Tom</h2>
          <p>After graduating from Expression College, I worked as a live sound engineer on a crew that ran all of the music venues in Oakland, California. Once covid-19 hit and shut down the live music scene completely, I decided it was time for a career change!</p>

          <p>Now, I am a student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a> and have begun my journey to become a full stack web developer!</p>

          <p>If you need to hire a new web developer who is also fluent in audio recording and mixing software - I am your guy!</p>
